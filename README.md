## Prerequisite:
1. Have a `python3` installed to run this program.

## What the Feature Is:
A simple python program which does a basic selection sort. The purpose of this exercise is to showcase my usage of Github for COSC 499. With this program, you can sort either words (strings/chars) or numbers(ints, floats, doubles, etc..)

## How to Use It:
1. Go to the directory and type the following command in terminal: `python3 -i unittest.py`
2. It should say `Everything Passed!` and then you can sort number and strings by typing `add(param1,param2)` or `minus(param1,param2)`. etc
Example Number: `add(1,2)` or Word : `minus(1,2)` etc
4. See the sorted arrays print after you hit enter.
